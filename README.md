### Deliver

To avoid forking the repo, create new Repository in your GitHub account and name it `ember-ui-code-challenge`.

Push the code to the newly created Github repo:

- `git push --mirror https://github.com/exampleuser/ember-ui-code-challenge.git`

## Requirements

- Add an "archive" button to all user profiles, with a confirmation prompt.
- Add an "archived" value of type boolean to the users.
- Display the archived value of true or false on the user profile.
- Change the archived boolean's value with the button created.
- Ensure that the archived value of the user changes when the button is clicked and yes is chosen in the confirmation. If they select "no" when asked if they are sure they would like to archive a user, the user should not be archived.
- All tests must still pass after this functionality is added. (eslint, and ember tests)
- implement with proper UI feedback like loading/error callbacks, e.g. with ember-concurrency.

## Useful information

- All user data is pulled from a mock back-end located in /server/mocks/users.js. This data correlates to a model in /app/models/users.js
- The user pages are using standard EmberJS routing.
- The CSS framework being used in this project is Bulma.

An example of modifying a value of a user is given on their profiles. They each have a simple boolean named "value", which can be toggled between true, or false with a button click. This button can be found on every users profile.
